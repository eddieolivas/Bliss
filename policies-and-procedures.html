	<h1>POLICY INFORMATION</h1>
	<p class="landing-page-body">It is our goal to offer the highest level of service to our valued customers.   Please contact us directly if you have questions about any of our products, services or the following policies.</p>
	<h4>Shipping Policy</h4>
	<p class="landing-page-body">
		We currently ship to physical addresses within the contiguous 48 United States only (no P.O. box addresses).  Shipping charges (if applicable) will be calculated at time of checkout once your shipping address has been provided.  Some items are stocked and shipped by 3rd Parties. Once your order is shipped you will receive a billing receipt which will include your tracking information.  It is possible for an order with multiple items to ship from different locations in which case you may receive a separate billing receipt email with tracking information for each delivery.  You can track your shipments at any time by following the tracking link in your order fulfillment email.  The shipper will call you to schedule an appointment for freight and white gloved deliveries. If you are unable to make your scheduled appointment then please notify the shipper in advance of them leaving the warehouse with your order. If you are not available to receive your delivery during the scheduled meeting time, there will be a re-delivery fee charged by us on behalf of the shipper for up to $200. Carefully inspect your item(s) when you receive them. Any damage must be communicated with the shipper at time of delivery.
	</p>
	<h4>Returns Policy</h4>
	<p class="landing-page-body">
		With certain exceptions, you will be able to return your item(s) within 30 days of the date of receipt. Exceptions include special order items and items from certain manufacturers and will be noted on these items' product detail pages or you will be notified for your approval prior to the processing of your order. Please contact us if you have any questions about an item's eligibility for return. If you wish to return an eligible item, it must be in new condition with the original packaging, including all parts, documentation and your receipt or packing slip.
	</p>
	<p class="landing-page-body">
		Products in the following condition are not eligible for return and will be sent back to you at your expense:<br>
		1. Any product that is returned without all original packaging, accessories, documentation and all other items originally included with the product.<br>
		2. Any product not purchased from Bliss Home And Design.<br>

	<p class="landing-page-body">
		A 15% return charge will be deducted from your credit. In the event of damage or product defect, a replacement order of equal or greater value must be placed for us to cover return shipping. Otherwise, your return will be considered a satisfaction guarantee and a 15% return charge will be deducted from your credit and your original shipping charges (if any) will not be refunded. You will receive your refund within 30 days of receipt and verification of your return. Your refund will be issued in the same manner in which you paid for the refunded product.

	<h4>Sales Tax Policy</h4>
	<p class="landing-page-body">

	</p>
	<h4>Credit Card Authorization</h4>
	<p class="landing-page-body">
		When you place an order with us, we authorize your credit or debit card to ensure that sufficient credit is available at the time of purchase. A hold is placed on funds in the amount of your order total until the order is fulfilled.  The time required to remove the authorization, if your order is canceled, is determined by the financial institution that issued your card. The estimated time needed for the various methods of payment are as follows:
		Visa/MasterCard - 7 days
		American Express - 30 days
		Debit or check cards - 7 days

You will have the option to cancel the order if you would prefer not to wait for the item to be in stock again. Your credit card will not be charged until the backordered item arrives back in stock and is fulfilled. Most out of stock items are in stock again within 2-4 weeks, but certain items such as new and end of life products can take longer or may never become available, in which case we will cancel your order and your card will not be charged. Certain items for sale on our site are not kept in inventory, but can be special ordered for you and shipped within the timeframe specified on the product�s detail page. These items will have the 'Special Order' indication.
